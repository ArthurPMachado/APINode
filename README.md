# Car Rental App

## A Node app to rental cars and with their images

The idea behind the project is for users to rental cars, for that the users can 
register the cars available with photos of them.

It's also a part of my personal portfolio, which I use to explore SOLID principles, API documentation, mail sending and attachments upload, which for them is used, respectively, SES and S3, both services from AWS
